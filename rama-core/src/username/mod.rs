//! # Username Parsing
//!
//! The [`parse_username`] function is used to parse a username and extract information from
//! its labels. The function takes a parser, which is used to parse the labels from the username.
//!
//! The parser is expected to implement the [`UsernameLabelParser`] trait, which has two methods:
//!
//! - `parse_label`: This method is called for each label in the username, and is expected to return
//!   whether the label was used or ignored.
//! - `build`: This method is called after all labels have been parsed, and is expected to consume
//!   the parser and store any relevant information.
//!
//! The parser can be a single parser or a tuple of parsers. Tuple parsers all receive all labels,
//! unless wrapped by a [`ExclusiveUsernameParsers`], in which case the first parser that consumes
//! a label will stop the iteration over the parsers.
//!
//! Parsers are to return [`UsernameLabelState::Used`] in case they consumed the label, and
//! [`UsernameLabelState::Ignored`] in case they did not. This way the parser-caller (e.g. [`parse_username`])
//! can decide whether to fail on ignored labels.
//!
//! # Username Composing
//!
//! Composing a username is the opposite of "Username Parsing",
//! and is used to suffix labels to a username.
