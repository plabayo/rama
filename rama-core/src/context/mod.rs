//! Context passed to and between services as input.
//!
//! # State
//!
//! [`rama`] supports two kinds of states:
//!
//! 1. type-safe state: this is the `S` generic parameter in [`Context`] and is to be used
//!    as much as possible, given its existence and type properties can be validated at compile time
//! 2. dynamic state: these can be injected as [`Extensions`]s using methods such as [`Context::insert`]
//!
//! As a rule of thumb one should use the type-safe state (1) in case:
//!
//! - the state is always expected to exist at the point the middleware/service is called
//! - the state is specific to the app or middleware
//! - and the state can be constructed in a default/empty state
//!
//! The latter is important given the state is often created (or at least reserved) prior to
//! it is actually being populated by the relevant middleware. This is not the case for app-specific state
//! such as Database pools which are created since the start and shared among many different tasks.
//!
//! The rule could be be simplified to "if you need to `.unwrap()` you probably want type-safe state instead".
//! It's however just a guideline and not a hard rule. As maintainers of [`rama`] we'll do our best to respect it though,
//! and we recommend you to do the same.
//!
//! Any state that is optional, and especially optional state injected by middleware, can be inserted using extensions.
//! It is however important to try as much as possible to then also consume this state in an approach that deals
//! gracefully with its absence. Good examples of this are header-related inputs. Headers might be set or not,
//! and so absence of [`Extensions`]s that might be created as a result of these might reasonably not exist.
//! It might of course still mean the app returns an error response when it is absent, but it should not unwrap/panic.
//!
//! [`rama`]: crate
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use rama_core::Context;
//!
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! struct ServiceState {
//!     value: i32,
//! }
//!
//! let state = ServiceState{ value: 5 };
//! let ctx = Context::with_state(state);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Example: Extensions
//!
//! The [`Context`] can be extended with additional data using the [`Extensions`] type.
//!
//! [`Context`]: crate::Context
//! [`Extensions`]: crate::context::Extensions
//!
//! ```
//! use rama_core::Context;
//!
//! let mut ctx = Context::default();
//! ctx.insert(5i32);
//! assert_eq!(ctx.get::<i32>(), Some(&5i32));
//! ```
//!
//! ## State Wraps
//!
//! > ðŸ“– [rustdoc link](https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/context/struct.Context.html#method.map_state)
//!
//! `rama` was built from the ground up to operate on and between different layers of the network stack.
//! This has also an impact on state. Because sure, typed state is nice, but state leakage is not. What do I mean with that?
//!
//! When creating a `TcpListener` with state the state will be owned by that `TcpListener`. By default
//! it will clone the state and pass a clone to each incoming `tcp` connection. You can however also
//! inject your own state provider to customise that behaviour. Pretty much the same goes for an `HttpServer`,
//! where it will do the same for each incoming http request. This is great for stuff that is okay to share, but it is not desired
//! for state that you wish to have a narrower scope. Examples are state that are tied to a single _tcp_ connection and thus
//! you do not wish to keep a global cache for this, as it would either be shared or get overly complicated to ensure
//! you keep things separate and clean.
//!
//! One solution is to wrap your state.
//!
//! > See for reference: [/examples/http_conn_state.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples/http_conn_state.rs)
//!
//! In that example we make use of:
//!
//! - [`MapStateLayer`](https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/layer/struct.MapStateLayer.html):
//!   this generic layer allows you to map the state from one type to another,
//!   which is great in cases like this where you want the Application layer (http)
//!   to have a different type compared to the network layer (tpc).
//! - the [`derive_more` third-party crate](https://docs.rs/derive_more/latest/derive_more/) is used
//!   as an example how one can use such crates to make services or layers which do not
//!   depend on a specific state type, but instead only require a reference (mutable or not)
//!   to specific properties they need, which can be useful in case that service
//!   is used in multiple branches, each with their own concrete _state_ type.
