# 0.2.0

> Release date: `2025-05-10`

ðŸŽ‰ **Rama 0.2.0 is out!** After 3+ years of R\&D, countless iterations, and production-grade usage, Rama is now a solid choice for building modular, high-performance clients, servers, and proxies â€” all in Rust. Rama strikes a balance between flexibility and structure, with full customizability, batteries included, and a growing ecosystem of real-world adopters.

Rama is still evolving, but already powers terabytes of traffic daily across production deployments. Read the full announcement: [ðŸŽ‰ Rama 0.2 â€” 3+ Years in the Making](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/discussions/544)
