//! Tower support for Rama.
//!
//! See <https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/examples/http_rama_tower.rs>
//! for an example on how to use this crate with opt-in tower support for rama.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Rama has the concept of a [`Context`], containing dynamic and static state,
//! as well as runtime utilities. Tower does not have this. While it is possible
//! that rama will move also away from the [`Context`] concept all together
//! (see <https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues/462>), it is there for now,
//! which is an issue for [`tower::Layer`]-[`tower::Service`]s in specific.
//!
//! ```plain
//! +-----------+         +-----------+         +-----------+
//! | serviceA  |         | serviceB  |         | serviceC  |
//! |           |         |           |         |           |
//! | serve(ctx, req)     | call(req) |         | serve(ctx, req)
//! |   |                 |    |      |         |     |
//! |   |                 |    |      |         |     |
//! |   +--> [ctx]        |    |      |         |     |
//! |         |           |    |      |         |     |
//! |         +---------->+---+------>+-------->+     |
//! |        passes req   |  calls C, but only  |     |
//! |        & ctx held   |  has req, so must   |     |
//! |        somewhere    |  forward ctx        |     |
//! +-----------+         +-----------+         +-----------+
//! ```
//!
//! That is where the [`ContextSmuggler`] trait comes into play.
//!
//! Note that this is only a problem for [`tower::Layer`]-[`tower::Service`]s,
//! and not for (leaf/endpoint) [`tower::Service`]s.
//!
//! ### [`tower::Service`] adapters
//!
//! Adapters to use a [`tower::Service`] as a [`rama::Service`].
//!
//! - either [`ServiceAdapter`]: [`Clone`] / call, most commonly used and also what we do for the layer version;
//! - or [`SharedServiceAdapter`]: shared service across all calls, locked using an async [`Mutex`], less commonly
//!   done, but there if you really have to.
//!
//! ### [`tower::Layer`] adapters
//!
//! Adapters to use a [`tower::Layer`] as a [`rama::Layer`]. Adapting layers
//! is a bit more complicated than _service_ adapters because of the entire
//! [`Context`] smuggling troubles.
//!
//! Next to that there is the fact that a layer produces
//! a service which also has to be wrapped, or in our case we have to wrap 2 times.
//! Once we have to wrap it to turn the "inner" [`rama::Service`] ("service C" in the above diagram)
//! into a [`tower::Service`] and produce the resulting [`tower::Service`] produced by the wrapped
//! [`tower::Layer`] also into a [`rama::Service`] ("service A" in the above diagram).
//!
//! To make this all happen and possible we have the following components:
//!
//! - [`LayerAdapter`]: use a [`tower::Layer`] as a [`rama::Layer`], which ensures that:
//!   - the inner [`rama::Service`] passed to the adapted [`tower::Layer`] is first
//!     wrapped by a [`TowerAdapterService`] to ensure it is a [`tower::Service`];
//!   - the produced [`tower::Service`] by the [`tower::Layer`] is turned into a [`rama::Service`]
//!     by wrapping it with a [`LayerAdapterService`].
//!
//! It is the [`LayerAdapterService`] which makes use of [`ContextSmuggler::inject_ctx`] to smuggle the [`Context`],
//! such that the nested [`TowerAdapterService`] can pass it on using [`ContextSmuggler::try_extract_ctx`]
//! to the "most" inner [`rama::Service`] from the POV of this (sub)stack.
//!
//! [`Context`]: rama_core::Context
//! [`ContextSmuggler::inject_ctx`]: layer::ContextSmuggler::inject_ctx
//! [`ContextSmuggler::try_extract_ctx`]: layer::ContextSmuggler::try_extract_ctx
//! [`ContextSmuggler`]: layer::ContextSmuggler
//! [`tower::Service`]: tower_service::Service
//! [`tower::Layer`]: tower_layer::Layer
//! [`rama::Service`]: rama_core::Service
//! [`rama::Layer`]: rama_core::Layer
//!
//! ## Halting
//!
//! The adapters in this carate assumes that a [`tower::Service`] will always become ready eventually,
//! as it will call [`poll_ready`] until ready prior to [`calling`] the [`tower::Service`].
//! Please ensure that your [`tower::Service`] does not require a side-step to prevent such halting.
//!
//! [`poll_ready`]: tower_service::Service::poll_ready
//! [`calling`]: tower_service::Service::call
//!
//! ## Rama
//!
//! Crate used by the end-user `rama` crate and `rama` crate authors alike.

//!
//! ## Rama Tower Origins
//!
//! Initially Rama was designed fully around the idea of Tower, directly. The initial design of Rama took many
//! iterations and was R&D'd over a timespan of about a year, in between other work and parenting.
//! We switched between [`tower`](https://crates.io/crates/tower),
//! [`tower-async`](https://crates.io/crates/tower-async)
//! (our own public fork of tower) and back to [`tower`](https://crates.io/crates/tower) again...
//!
//! It became clear however that the version of [`tower`](https://crates.io/crates/tower)
//! at the time was incompatible (and still is) with the ideas which we wanted it to have:
//!
//! - We are not interested in the `poll_ready` code of tower,
//!   and in fact it would be harmful if something is used which makes use of it
//!   (Axum warns for it, but strictly it is possible...);
//!   - This idea is also further elaborated in the FAQ of our tower-async fork:
//!     <https://github.com/plabayo/tower-async?tab=readme-ov-file#faq>
//! - We want to start to prepare for an `async`-ready future as soon as we can...
//!
//! All in all, it was clear after several iterations that usage of tower did more
//! harm then it did good. What was supposed to be a stack to help us implement our vision,
//! became a hurdle instead.
//!
//! This is not the fault of tower, but more a sign that it did not age well,
//! or perhaps... it is actually a very different beast altogether.
//!
//! As both tower and rama are still in their pre "1.0" days, and
//! we are still evolving together and with the rest of the wider ecosystems,
//! it is possible that we grow closer once again.
