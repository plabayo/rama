# Transport Protocols

Transport protocols form the foundation of communication in networked applications.
In Rama, they’re not just a substrate—they’re fully integrated, layered services,
treated with the same flexibility and modularity as higher-level components.
This chapter explores how Rama supports and enhances [TCP][rama-tcp],
[UDP][rama-udp], and [Unix sockets][rama-unix], emwpoering you to build robust
and performant network applications.

Rama's layered architecture starts at the transport layer and goes *all the way up*.
This is a distinguishing trait: in most frameworks, transport is considered a
low-level concern that you configure once and forget. But in Rama, transport
protocols are first-class citizens. They participate in the same service
stack as application protocols, middleware, observability tools, and business logic.

## Streams and Datagrams

Before diving into specific protocols, it's important to understand the two primary
transport abstractions: streams and datagrams.

- **Streams** (like those provided by [TCP][rama-tcp] and [Unix][rama-unix] stream sockets) represent ordered, reliable, connection-oriented communication. They guarantee delivery and preserve the order of bytes.
- **Datagrams** (like those used in [UDP][rama-udp] and [Unix][rama-unix] datagram sockets) represent unordered, unreliable, connectionless communication. Each message stands alone.

Each abstraction has different strengths and trade-offs. Streams are great for
general-purpose applications like HTTP, SSH, and database access.
Datagrams are perfect for high-performance, latency-sensitive applications like DNS,
real-time telemetry, or custom RPC protocols.

## Remote vs Local

Another dimension in transport protocol design is **remote** vs **local** communication:

- **Remote transports** like TCP and UDP operate over the network stack and are ideal for client-server or peer-to-peer communication across machines.
- **Local transports** like Unix domain sockets (UDS) operate within a single host, using the filesystem as an addressing mechanism.

Unix sockets are especially useful for high-performance, secure inter-process communication (IPC).
They avoid the overhead of TCP while retaining the benefits of stream or datagram semantics.
In Rama, using Unix (Domain) Sockets (UDS) is as simple as switching out
the transport service—your layers, middleware, and application logic don’t need to change.

## Use Cases and Trade-offs

| Protocol | Abstraction | Communication | Reliable | Ordered | Typical Uses |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------|---------|--------------|
| [TCP][rama-tcp]     | Stream      | Remote        | ✅        | ✅       | HTTP, SSH, DBs |
| [UDP][rama-udp]     | Datagram    | Remote        | ❌        | ❌       | DNS, VoIP, custom RPC |
| [Unix][rama-unix]    | Stream/Datagram | Local     | ✅/❌     | ✅/❌     | IPC, reverse proxies, system daemons |

Each protocol has its place in the network programming toolbox. In Rama, your choice of protocol doesn't lock you into a specific architecture. Because the transport is just another service, you can build once and deploy across protocols with minimal changes.

Note that typical uses do not mean that these are the only uses or that a use mentioned for 1 protocol
cannot be served by another one. As usually it's a set of trade offs.

## Integration in Rama

- For both TCP and Unix (stream) sockets there are listeners that are the servers in this kind of relationship:
  - TCP: <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/tcp/server/struct.TcpListener.html>
  - Unix: <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/unix/server/struct.UnixListener.html>
- For connectionless communication using datagrams there is no client or server,
  and for those there are only the sockets to work with, regardless of which party:
  - UDP: <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/udp/struct.UdpSocket.html>
  - Unix: <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/unix/struct.UnixSocket.html>

For the connection-oriented streams there are also connectors to make it easy to establish connections in bigger stacks
(e.g. http within tls on top of tcp):

- TCP: <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/tcp/client/service/struct.TcpConnector.html>
- Unix: <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/unix/client/struct.UnixConnector.html>

## Examples

These examples show how easy it is to set up and extend Rama’s transport services,
and how they integrate seamlessly with the rest of the stack.

Rama doesn’t just support networking—it *is* networking, from transport to application.

- TCP:
  - [/examples/tcp_listener_hello.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/examples/tcp_listener_hello.rs):
    minimal tcp listener example
- UDP:
  - [/examples/udp_codec.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/examples/udp_codec.rs):
    an example which leverages `BytesCodec` to create a UDP client and server which speak a custom protocol
- Unix:
  - [/examples/unix_socket.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/examples/unix_socket.rs):
    a minimal example of a unix socket listener
  - [/examples/unix_socket_http.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/examples/unix_socket_http.rs):
    an example demonstrating how easy rama makes it to get a stack similar to tcp-http but with unix as the transport
  - [/examples/unix_datagram_codec.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/examples/unix_datagram_codec.rs):
    similar to the `udp_codec` example but using Unix datagram sockets
