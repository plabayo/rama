to know how to use rama for your purposes.

## â›¨ | Safety

This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% safe Rust.

## ðŸ¦€ | Compatibility

Rama (ãƒ©ãƒž) is developed mostly on MacOS M-Series machines and run in production
on a variety of Linux systems. Windows support is not officially guaranteed,
but is [tested using Github Actions](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI.yml) with success.

| platform | tested | test platform |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| MacOS    | âœ…     | M2 (developer laptop) and macos-12 Intel ([GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)) |
| Windows  | âœ…     | Windows 2022 ([GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)) |
| Linux    | âœ…     | Ubuntu 22.04 ([GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)) |

Please [open a ticket](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues) in case you have compatibility issues for your setup/platform.
Our goal is not to support all possible platformns in the world, but we do want to
support as many as we reasonably can.

### Minimum supported Rust version

Rama's MSRV is `1.75`.

[Using GitHub Actions we also test](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI.yml) if `rama` on that version still works on
the stable and beta versions of _rust_ as well.

## ðŸ‘‹ | Contributing

ðŸŽˆ Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have
you! We have a [contributing guide][contributing] to help you get involved in the
`rama` project.

Contributions often come from people who already know what they want, be it a fix for a bug they encountered,
or a feature that they are missing. Please do always make a ticket if one doesn't exist already.

It's possible however that you do not yet know what specifically to contribute, and yet want to help out.
For that we thank you. You can take a look at the open issues, and in particular:

- [`good first issue`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22): issues that are good for those new to the `rama` codebase;
- [`easy`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy): issues that are seen as easy;
- [`mentor available`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22mentor+available%22): issues for which we offer mentorship;
- [`low prio`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22low+prio%22): low prio issues that have no immediate pressure to be finished quick, great in case you want to help out but can only do with limited time to spare;

In general, any issue not assigned already is free to be picked up by anyone else. Please do communicate in the ticket
if you are planning to pick it up, as to avoid multiple people trying to solve the same one.

Should you want to contribure this project but you do not yet know how to program in Rust, you could start learning Rust with as goal to contribute as soon as possible to `rama` by using "[the Rust 101 Learning Guide](https://rust-lang.guide/)" as your study companion. Glen can also be hired as a mentor or teacher to give you paid 1-on-1 lessons and other similar consultancy services. You can find his contact details at <https://www.glendc.com/>.
