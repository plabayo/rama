        SOCKS is an Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server. SOCKS5 optionally provides authentication so only authorized users may access a server. Practically, a SOCKS server proxies TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and provides a means for UDP packets to be forwarded.

There are currently
[no examples found in the `/examples` dir](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples)
on how to create such a proxy using rama. If you are interested in contributing this
you can create an issue at <https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues> and we'll
help you to get this shipped.

## Description

<div class="book-article-image-center">

```dot process
digraph {
    pad=0.2;
    "client" -> "proxy (rama)" [dir=both]
    "proxy (rama)" -> "server A" [dir=both]
    "proxy (rama)" -> "server B" [dir=both]
}
```

</div>

You'll notice that the above graph is the exact same one used in
[the http(s) Proxies chapter](./http.md). This is no coincidence,
as topology wise they are the same.

The key differences are:

- SOCKS5 proxies do not operate on the application layer, and sit directly on the application layer;
  - This means they have no need to touch for example the http packets at all, unless they want to;
  - It is also one of the reasons that they are typically said to be faster, given the SOCKS protocol,
    is fairly trivial and cheaply to interpret;
- These proxies also support UDP traffic, which is not commonly associated with [HTTP proxies](./http.md);

The SOCKS5 protocol is however in plaintext, just
like is the case with [HTTP Proxy authentication](./http.md).
Depending on your client support you can tunnel it through a TLS connection,
which from the Rama proxy perspective you can easily achieve.

Similar to [HTTP proxies](./http.md), a SOCKS5 proxy can only do routing of connections,
but can just as easily sniff the application packets and as such be [a MITM proxy](./mitm.md).
It can even go further and actively mold the packets and therefore be more of
[a Distortion proxy](./distort.md).

## Transport Proxies

Proxies that operate on the TCP/UDP layers are also referred to as "transport proxies".
Socks5 proxies are an example of this. An [http proxy](./http.md) can also be a transport proxy,
and in fact most commcercial proxies out in the wild are just that. The key difference
with socks5 proxies is however that for plain text requests it is still
the (http) proxy that will see the http request to be proxied, while even for plain text
requests (read: not encrypted with TLS) socks5 proxies do not _have_ to see the requests.

That said, regardless if you expose yourself as an [http proxy](./http.md) or socks5 proxy,
you can if you want to still run your proxy as a [Man In The Middle Proxy](./mitm.md),
and at that point you are no longer a transport proxy, but do see the http requests coming by,
regardless if they were initially secured via tls.
