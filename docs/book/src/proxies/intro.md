        Proxy — An intermediary program which acts as both a server and a client
         for the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients.
         Requests are serviced internally or by passing them on, with
         possible translation, to other servers.

There are many kinds of proxies. In this chapter we'll go over
which are the common ones that exist and that you may choose
to build with rama.

It must be noted that many proxy servers will be a combination of
different kinds and some are a superset of another one.

In specifically we'll discuss:

- [🚦 Reverse proxies](./reverse.md)
- [🔓 TLS Termination proxies](./tls.md)
- [🌐 HTTP(S) proxies](./http.md)
- [🧦 SOCKS5 proxies](./socks5.md)
- [🔎 MITM proxies](./mitm.md)
- [🕵️‍♀️ Distortion proxies](./distort.md)
- [🧭 HaProxy](./haproxy.md)
