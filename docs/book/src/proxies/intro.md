        Proxy — An intermediary program which acts as both a server and a client
         for the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients.
         Requests are serviced internally or by passing them on, with
         possible translation, to other servers.
        <p>— <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3507">RFC 3507 (ICAP)</a></p>

There are many kinds of proxies. In this chapter we'll go over
which are the common ones that exist and that you may choose
to build with rama.

It must be noted that many proxy servers will be a combination of
different kinds and some are a superset of another one.

In specifically we'll discuss:

- [🚦 Reverse proxies](./reverse.md)
- [🔓 TLS Termination proxies](./tls.md)
- [🌐 HTTP(S) proxies](./http.md)
- [🧦 SOCKS5 proxies](./socks5.md)
- [🔓 SNI proxies](./sni.md)
- [🔎 MITM proxies](./mitm.md)
- [🕵️‍♀️ Distortion proxies](./distort.md)
- [🧭 HaProxy (PROXY protocol)](./haproxy.md)

Once you are comfortable with these intro topics in proxies,
please read also the [the proxy operation chapters](./operate/intro.md)
and learn how your proxies can be integrated into computer boxes
from servers, to middle boxes and end user devices.
