# üíñ Sponsor

Plabayo was co-founded in 2021 by Elizabeth C. Gonzales Belsuzarri and Glen Henri J. De Cauwsemaecker
to develop free and open source software, next to providing consultancy and educational services.

Rama has its roots in R&D in proxy technology, but active development on Rama started only at the begin of 2022.

Next to becoming a code contributor and/or code user you can also choose to financially sponsor
Plabayo which allows us to continue to develop it as free and open source technology,
licensed permissively.

Next to the many unpaid developer hours we put in a project such as `rama`,
we also have plenty of costs, such as services ranging from hosting to Docker,
but also tooling for developers and automated processing. All these costs money.

One time or monthly contributions can be made via GitHub Sponsors at
<https://github.com/sponsors/plabayo>, where you can also read about our different
tiers for the monthly version.

Alternatively you can also make a one time contribution at
<https://www.buymeacoffee.com/plabayo>.

Finally, you can also support us by shopping Plabayo <3 `„É©„Éû` merchandise üõçÔ∏è at <https://plabayo.threadless.com/>.
