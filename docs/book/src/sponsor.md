Plabayo was co-founded in 2021 by Elizabeth C. Gonzales Belsuzarri and Glen Henri J. De Cauwsemaecker
to develop free and open source software, next to providing consultancy and educational services.

Rama has its roots in R&D of proxy technology, and active development on Rama started at the beginning of 2022.

Next to becoming a code contributor and/or code user you can also choose to financially sponsor
Plabayo which allows us to continue to develop it as free and open source technology,
licensed permissively.

Financial contributors help in compensate for the many unpaid developer hours we put in a project such as `rama`, but we also have plenty of costs, such as services ranging from hosting to Docker, but also tooling for developers and automated processing. All these costs money.

## 💎 | Financial Contributions

You can become a regular financial contributor to Rama by paying for a monthly subscription at [polar.sh/plabayo](https://polar.sh/plabayo/subscriptions). In case you want a specific github issue to be resolved or like you can also fund issues via that platform. One time contributions are possible as well and greatly appreciated.

> 💡 Business subscriptions are available at [polar.sh/plabayo](https://polar.sh/plabayo/subscriptions) for businesses, enterprises and individuals who can afford it 🙏. These subscriptions keep the development of Rama and other projects sustainable and unlocks support for you and your team in the integration and usage of Rama.
>
> 👉 For even more custom integrations or features you can always get in touch by sending an email to [glen@plabayo.tech](mailto:glen@plabayo.tech).

Alternatively you can also become a (monthly subscriber) sponsor or pay a one-time donation via [Github Sponsors][ghs-url]. For one-time donations you are also free to use ["Buy me a Coffee"][bmac-url] or ["Paypal Donations"][paypal-url] in case you are more at ease with any of these.

Sponsors help us continue to maintain and improve `rama`, as well as other
Free and Open Source (FOSS) technology. It also helps us to create
educational content such as <https://github.com/plabayo/learn-rust-101>,
and other open source libraries such as <https://github.com/plabayo/tokio-graceful> and <https://venndb.rs>.

Finally, you can also support us by shopping Plabayo <3 `ラマ` merchandise 🛍️ at <https://plabayo.threadless.com/>.
