# Http Clients

In [The "🗼 Services all the way down 🐢" chapter](./intro/services_all_the_way_down.md) you can read and learn that a big pillar of Rama's architecture is build on top of the [`Service`][rama-service] concept. A [`Service`][rama-service] takes a `Request`, and uses it to serve either a `Response` or `Error`. Such a [`Service`][rama-service] can produce the response "directly" (also called ☘️ Leaf services) or instead pass the request to an inner [`Service`][rama-service] which it wraps around (so called 🍔 Middlewares).

[rama-service]: https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/service/trait.Service.html

It's a powerful concept, originally introduced to Rust by [the Tower ecosystem](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower) and allows you build complex stacks specialised to your needs in a modular and easy manner. Even cooler is that this works for both clients and servers alike.

Rama provides an [`EasyHttpWebClient`](https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/http/client/struct.EasyHttpWebClient.html) which sends your _Http_ `Request` over the network and returns the `Response` if it receives and read one or an `Error` otherwise. Combined with [the many Layers (middleware)](https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/http/layer/index.html) that `Rama` provides and perhaps also some developed by you it is possible to create a powerful _Http_ client suited to your needs.

As a 🍒 cherry on the cake you can import the [`HttpClientExt`](https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/http/service/client/trait.HttpClientExt.html) trait in your Rust module to be able to use your _Http_ Client [`Service`][rama-service] stack using a high level API to build and send requests with ease.

> [!NOTE]
> The same client-side composition model is also used by
> Rama's gRPC support. See the dedicated [gRPC chapter](./grpc.md)
