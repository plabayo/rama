# ‚òÄÔ∏è Context\<State\>

To recap, a `Service::serve` method has the following signature:

```rust,noplayground
fn serve(
    &self,
    ctx: Context<State>,
    req: Request,
) -> impl Future<Output = Result<Self::Response, Self::Error>> + Send + '_;
```

- `&self` allows services to access shared `Send + Sync + 'static` state internal and specific to that `Service`;
- `Request` is the input used to produce a `Result`.

`Context<State>` is what this chapter is about,
and its documemtation can be consumed at <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/context/struct.Context.html>.

`Context<State>` is used to:

- access shared typesafe `State` defined by the code location instantiating the `Service` on its own or part of a _stack_.
- access `Extensions` that can be used to dynamically get and set extra (optional) data, to be passed for usage by inner service(s).
- spawn tasks for the given (async) executor, doing so gracefully if configured to do so.
- abrubt tasks early in a graceful manner in case of a shutdown using the gracuful `ShutdownGuard` if defined.

This is a clear distinction from a `Tower` service which only takes a `Request`.
If that `Request` is an `http Request` it does allow one to add extra optional data using
the `Extensions` type/data also available in an `http Request`. However it provides no means
of typesafe `State`, executors, spawning etc. On top of that it would make it more awkward to
also freely pass all this data between services, especially those operating
across different layers of the network.

## State

`rama` supports two kinds of states:

1. type-safe state: this is the `S` generic parameter in [`Context`] and is to be used
   as much as possible, given its existence and type properties can be validated at compile time
2. dynamic state: these can be injected as [`Extensions`]s using methods such as [`Context::insert`]

As a rule of thumb one should use the type-safe state (1) in case:

- the state is always expected to exist at the point the middleware/service is called
- the state is specific to the app or middleware
- and the state can be constructed in a default/empty state

The latter is important given the state is often created (or at least reserved) prior to
it is actually being populated by the relevant middleware. This is not the case for app-specific state
such as Database pools which are created since the start and shared among many different tasks.

The rule could be be simplified to "if you need to `.unwrap()` you probably want type-safe state instead".
It's however just a guideline and not a hard rule. As maintainers of `rama` we'll do our best to respect it though,
and we recommend you to do the same.

Any state that is optional, and especially optional state injected by middleware, can be inserted using extensions.
It is however important to try as much as possible to then also consume this state in an approach that deals
gracefully with its absence. Good examples of this are header-related inputs. Headers might be set or not,
and so absence of [`Extensions`]s that might be created as a result of these might reasonably not exist.
It might of course still mean the app returns an error response when it is absent, but it should not unwrap/panic.

## State Wraps

> üìñ [rustdoc link](https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/context/struct.Context.html#method.map_state)

`rama` was built from the ground up to operate on and between different layers of the network stack.
This has also an impact on state. Because sure, typed state is nice, but state leakage is not. What do I mean with that?

When creating a `TcpListener` with state the state will be owned by that `TcpListener`. By default
it will clone the state and pass a clone to each incoming `tcp` connection. You can however also
inject your own state provider to customise that behaviour. Pretty much the same goes for an `HttpServer`,
where it will do the same for each incoming http request. This is great for stuff that is okay to share, but it is not desired
for state that you wish to have a narrower scope. Examples are state that are tied to a single _tcp_ connection and thus
you do not wish to keep a global cache for this, as it would either be shared or get overly complicated to ensure
you keep things separate and clean.

One solution is to wrap your state.

> See for reference: [/examples/http_conn_state.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples/http_conn_state.rs)

In that example we make use of:

- [`MapStateLayer`](https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/layer/struct.MapStateLayer.html):
  this generic layer allows you to map the state from one type to another,
  which is great in cases like this where you want the Application layer (http)
  to have a different type compared to the network layer (tpc).
- the [`derive_more` third-party crate](https://docs.rs/derive_more/latest/derive_more/) is used
  as an example how one can use such crates to make services or layers which do not
  depend on a specific state type, but instead only require a reference (mutable or not)
  to specific properties they need, which can be useful in case that service
  is used in multiple branches, each with their own concrete _state_ type.
