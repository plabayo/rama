🦙 Rama (ラマ) is a modular proxy framework for the 🦀 Rust language to move and transform your network packets.
The reasons behind the creation of rama can be read in [the "Why Rama" chapter](https://ramaproxy.org/book/why_rama).

You can use it to develop:

- 🚦 [Reverse proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/reverse);
- 🔓 [TLS Termination proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/tls);
- 🌐 [HTTP(S) proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/http);
- 🧦 [SOCKS5 proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/socks5) (will be implemented in `v0.3`);
- 🔎 [MITM proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/mitm);
- 🕵️‍♀️ [Distortion proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/distort) <sup>(\*)</sup>.

And all kind of other proxies that you can think of. Next to this Rama can also be used
for developing [web servers](https://ramaproxy.org/book/web_servers.html). Within a proxy setting this can be useful
in case you want to hijack certain requests with your custom server, or because you want to use pseudo domains
to serve an API as part of your proxy. Or you might want to serve your MITM TLS certs. And of course you might also
use it to develop a regular web service, which comes with all the great benefits that rama has to offer for developing proxies.

In fact you can even
[use rama as a high-level highly customisable http client](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples/http_high_level_client.rs),
as part of your proxy, an emulated UA or just a plain old http client, made for you. Because you... deserve it!

In short... Rama (ラマ) is a framework to help you move and transform network packets. The primary
focus is distortion proxies, but you'll see, it can do so much more. And [with your help](#--contributing) it will only become better.

> <sup>(\*)</sup> The [Distortion proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/distort) support
> comes with UA emulation capabilities. Part of this uses actual browser fingerprint information
> generated by [`rama-fp`](./rama-fp/), Responsible for the collection, storage and transformation
> of browser fingerprint data, as is relevant for `rama`.
>
> While this is not meant for humans, you can also use the public facing service yourself,
> to get to know your own UA a bit better. It also gives you insights in the Rama POV,
> and what might still need to be improved.
>
> The service is available at <https://fp.ramaproxy.org>.
>
> Developers can also make use of <https://echo.ramaproxy.org>,
> to test if their requests would reach their target in the way they expect it to.

Rama is async-first using [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) as its _only_ Async Runtime.
Please refer to [the examples found in the `/examples` dir](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples)
to get inspired on how you can use it for your purposes.

- Learn more by reading the Rama book at <https://ramaproxy.org/book>;
- or checkout the framework Rust docs at <https://docs.rs/rama>;
    - edge docs (for main branch) can be found at <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama>.

There is no [crates.io](https://crates.io) release of rama yet.
If you already want to start using rama already your can do so by referring to it in your `Cargo.toml` as follows:

```
rama = { git = "https://github.com/plabayo/rama" }
```

💬 Come join us at [Discord][discord-url] on the `#rama` public channel. To ask questions, discuss ideas and ask how rama may be useful for you.

> ⚠️ rama is early work in progress, use at your own risk.
>
> Not everything that exists is documented and not everything that is documented is implemented.

📖 Rama's full documentation, references and background material can be found in the form of the "rama book" at <https://ramaproxy.org/book>.

## ⛨ | Safety

This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% safe Rust.

## 🦀 | Compatibility

Rama (ラマ) is developed mostly on MacOS M-Series machines and run in production
on a variety of Linux systems. Windows support is not officially guaranteed,
but is [tested using Github Actions](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI.yml) with success.

| platform | tested | test platform |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| MacOS    | ✅     | M2 (developer laptop) and macos-12 Intel ([GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)) |
| Windows  | ✅     | Windows 2022 ([GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)) |
| Linux    | ✅     | Ubuntu 22.04 ([GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)) |

Please [open a ticket](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues) in case you have compatibility issues for your setup/platform.
Our goal is not to support all possible platformns in the world, but we do want to
support as many as we reasonably can.

### Minimum supported Rust version

Rama's MSRV is `1.75`.

[Using GitHub Actions we also test](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI.yml) if `rama` on that version still works on
the stable and beta versions of _rust_ as well.

## 🧭 | Roadmap

Please refer to <https://github.com/plabayo/rama/milestones> to know what's on the roadmap. Is there something not on the roadmap for the next version that you would really like? Please [create a feature request](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues) to request it and [become a sponsor](#--sponsors) if you can.

## 💼 | License

This project is dual-licensed under both the [MIT license][mit-license] and [Apache 2.0 License][apache-license].

## 👋 | Contributing

🎈 Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have
you! We have a [contributing guide][contributing] to help you get involved in the
`rama` project.

Contributions often come from people who already know what they want, be it a fix for a bug they encountered,
or a feature that they are missing. Please do always make a ticket if one doesn't exist already.

It's possible however that you do not yet know what specifically to contribute, and yet want to help out.
For that we thank you. You can take a look at the open issues, and in particular:

- [`good first issue`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22): issues that are good for those new to the `rama` codebase;
- [`easy`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy): issues that are seen as easy;
- [`mentor available`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22mentor+available%22): issues for which we offer mentorship;
- [`low prio`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22low+prio%22): low prio issues that have no immediate pressure to be finished quick, great in case you want to help out but can only do with limited time to spare;

In general, any issue not assigned already is free to be picked up by anyone else. Please do communicate in the ticket
if you are planning to pick it up, as to avoid multiple people trying to solve the same one.

Should you want to contribure this project but you do not yet know how to program in Rust, you could start learning Rust with as goal to contribute as soon as possible to `rama` by using "[the Rust 101 Learning Guide](https://rust-lang.guide/)" as your study companion. Glen can also be hired as a mentor or teacher to give you paid 1-on-1 lessons and other similar consultancy services. You can find his contact details at <https://www.glendc.com/>.

### Contribution

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in `rama` by you, shall be licensed as both [MIT][mit-license] and [Apache 2.0][apache-license],
without any additional terms or conditions.

[contributing]: https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
[mit-license]: https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT
[apache-license]: https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE

### Acknowledgements

Special thanks goes to all involved in developing, maintaining and supporting [the Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), the [Tokio ecosystem](https://tokio.rs/) and [all other crates](./Cargo.toml) that we depend upon. This also includes [Hyper and its ecosystem](https://github.com/hyperium) as without those projects Rama would not be. The core http module of rama is a specialised fork of `hyper` and use the underlying `h2` and `h3` crates as dependencies.

Extra credits also go to [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), from which ideas and code were copied as its a project very much in line with the kind of software we want Rama to be, but for a different purpose. Our hats also go off to [Tower][Tower], its inventors and all the people and creatures that help make it be every day. The service concept is derived from [Tower][Tower] and many of our layers are a [Tower][Tower] fork, adapted where required or desired.

An extra big shoutout goes also to the online communities surrounding and part of these ecosystems. They are a great place to hangout and always friendly and helpful. Thanks.

## 💖 | Sponsors

Rama is **completely free, open-source software** which needs lots of effort and time to develop and maintain.

Support this project by becoming a [sponsor][ghs-url]. One time payments are accepted [at GitHub][ghs-url] as well as at ["Buy me a Coffee"][bmac-url].

One-time and monthly financial contributions are also possible via Paypal, should you feel more at ease with that at ["Paypal Donations"][paypal-url].

Sponsors help us continue to maintain and improve `rama`, as well as other
Free and Open Source (FOSS) technology. It also helps us to create
educational content such as <https://github.com/plabayo/learn-rust-101>,
and other open source libraries such as <https://github.com/plabayo/tower-async>.

Next to the many unpaid developer hours we put in a project such as `rama`,
we also have plenty of costs, such as services ranging from hosting to Docker,
but also tooling for developers and automated processing. All these costs money.

Sponsors receive perks and depending on your regular contribution it also
allows you to rely on us for support and consulting.

Finally, you can also support us by shopping Plabayo <3 `ラマ` merchandise 🛍️ at <https://plabayo.threadless.com/>.

## 🌱 | Alternatives

While there are a handful of proxies written in Rust, there are only two other Rust frameworks
specifically made for proxy purposes. All other proxy codebases are single purpose code bases,
some even just for learning purposes. Or are actually generic http/web libraries/frameworks
that facilitate proxy features as an extra.

[Cloudflare] has been working on a proxy service framework, named [`pingora`], since a couple of years already,
and on the 28th of February of 2024 they also open sourced it.

Rama is not for everyone, but we sure hope it is right for you.
If not, consider giving [`pingora`] a try, it might very well be the next best thing for you.

Secondly, [ByteDance] has an open source proxy framework written in Rust to developer forward
and reverse proxies alike, named [`g3proxy`].
