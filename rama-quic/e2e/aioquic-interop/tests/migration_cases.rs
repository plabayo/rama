//! The shared migration cases, run against aioquic in both roles.
//!
//! Its client can move: `QuicConnectionProtocol` sends through the transport it holds, so the
//! child hands it a second datagram endpoint and routes what arrives there back into the same
//! connection. Its own path state describes the address it is sending *to*, so in that role it
//! holds no verdict on the tuple it moved from. As a server the path is the peer's, so there
//! its `is_validated` does refer to the client that moved.
//!
//! Neither role can withhold an identifier: aioquic issues its own and rama issues its own.
//! Its client does not read rama's `disable_active_migration` either, so the forbidden case
//! in the rama-server role is a client that moves against the policy and then returns. Its
//! server configuration cannot refuse a move, so that case is recorded in the rama-client
//! role rather than run.
