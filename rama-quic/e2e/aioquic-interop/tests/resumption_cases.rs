//! The shared resumption and 0-RTT cases, run against aioquic as the server.
//!
//! aioquic reports both verdicts in its handshake event, `session_resumed` and
//! `early_data_accepted`, so neither is inferred from the other. What it cannot be made to do
//! is resume a session and refuse the early data offered on it: a server there is built with
//! `max_early_data=MAX_EARLY_DATA` whatever the configuration says (`quic/connection.py`), and
//! it accepts early data whenever the offered ticket validates (`tls.py`). That case is
//! recorded as unsupported rather than run against something else.
