//! The shared key-update cases: an update asked for by one side or the other, and one asked
//! for by neither.
//!
//! Traffic crosses before and after the update, so a case says the connection still works
//! under the new keys rather than only that a counter moved.
//!
//! A connection can also update its keys without being asked: `key_phase_size` starts as a
//! random `10..1000` packets (`proto/connection/mod.rs`) and the packet builder updates the
//! keys once that many have gone out under them (`packet_builder.rs`); quinn's peer does the
//! same. After any update that size becomes the keys' confidentiality limit less a margin,
//! which no case here approaches. So a case that counts updates settles the phase first with
//! one deliberate update, and what it counts afterwards is only what it asked for.
//!
//! Where the peer asks, the request is made, an exchange is driven behind it so a request that
//! was taken can travel, and the count says whether it was; the asking stops at the first
//! update seen. A peer that cannot start an update while the settling one is in flight
//! (RFC 9001 §6.1) is simply asked again. Two facts are kept apart: Rama
//! counts the updates it makes and follows (`ConnectionStats::key_updates`), and the peer says
//! what key phase it is using, where its own API has one. A peer with no phase to report is
//! recorded as such.
