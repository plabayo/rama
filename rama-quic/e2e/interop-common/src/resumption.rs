//! The shared resumption and 0-RTT cases: a session taken up again, and early data offered on
//! it, accepted or refused.
//!
//! Three facts are kept apart here, because a peer can give one without the others: whether the
//! client had a ticket to offer at all, whether the session was resumed, and whether early data
//! was accepted. Rama's own side reports the first and the third — `into_0rtt` succeeding is the
//! ticket, and the verdict it hands back is the acceptance — while the resumption itself is only
//! visible to the server, so it comes back through the peer's own report.
//!
//! Every payload is an echo of bytes the case names, so a payload sent twice after a refusal
//! carries no side effect the second time.
