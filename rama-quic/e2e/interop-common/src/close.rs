//! The shared close cases: an application close carrying a code and a reason, read back by the
//! other side, sent after an exchange or immediately after the handshake.
//!
//! What a case checks is what the side that did not close was told: the code and the reason.
//! The side that closes is always the one that opened the exchange, so it has read the answer
//! before it closes. A close is not a promise that anything still in flight arrives — RFC 9000
//! §10.2 lets the peer drop what it had buffered — and no case here depends on one.
//!
//! Each role covers one direction of the reporting: with Rama as the client, Rama closes and
//! the peer reports; with Rama as the server, the peer's client closes and Rama reports.
