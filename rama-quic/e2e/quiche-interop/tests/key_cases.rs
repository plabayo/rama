//! The shared key-update cases, run against quiche in both roles.
//!
//! quiche follows an update but cannot be asked to start one: its public surface has no
//! initiator — `key_phase` is private, and the `pub fn`s about keys are the key files,
//! `log_keys`, `set_keylog` and `set_ticket_key` — so the peer-asks case is recorded
//! unsupported rather than run as something else, and the phase it is in is not reported
//! either. Rama's own count is what says an update happened.
