//! quiche reports the other side's close through `peer_error`, which says whether it was an
//! application close and carries the code and the reason.
//!
//! The case that closes as its first act used to fail here: rama coalesced its Handshake and
//! 1-RTT closes into one datagram, and this peer, having discarded its Handshake keys, made
//! nothing of either packet. The closes go in separate datagrams now, and the case at the end
//! of this file records what arrives.
