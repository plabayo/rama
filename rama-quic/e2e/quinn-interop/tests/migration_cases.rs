//! The shared migration cases, run against Quinn in both roles.
//!
//! Quinn's server can be told to forbid a move (`ServerConfig::migration`) and reports where a
//! connection is coming from, so those cases run. It issues connection identifiers itself,
//! with nothing in its configuration to withhold them, so the case that withholds one is
//! recorded rather than run as something else.
//!
//! Its client does not read the server's `disable_active_migration`, so the forbidden case in
//! the rama-server role is a client that moves against the policy. The socket it was made on
//! is held here as an `Arc<dyn AsyncUdpSocket>` and given back through `rebind_abstract`, so
//! that client can return to the path the server still holds.
