//! The shared resumption and 0-RTT cases, run against Quinn as the server.
//!
//! Quinn's server side reports neither verdict itself: `HandshakeData` carries the protocol
//! and the name and nothing about resumption, and `into_0rtt` on an incoming connection always
//! succeeds with a verdict of true (quinn 0.11.11, `src/connection.rs`), so it says nothing
//! about the client's early data.
//!
//! What this adapter observes instead is the one event that makes a session resume here:
//! Rama's own handshake, through `NegotiatedTlsParameters::resumed`. The server's session store is
//! wrapped as well, but only to say what rustls looked for: a lookup that found something is
//! not a resumption, and the counts are diagnostics.
//!
//! Resumption is stateful here and not by ticket, because rustls implements RFC 8446 §8.1 by
//! allowing early data only with stateful resumption: `server/tls13.rs` reads
//! `max_early_data_size > 0 && !config.ticketer.enabled()`, so a server with a ticketer resumes
//! and can never accept early data.
//!
//! Early-data acceptance is the server's own answer, and it reaches the client through the
//! handshake, where the shared code asserts it. Nothing here guesses at it: this side reports
//! it unavailable.
