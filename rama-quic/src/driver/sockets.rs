//! Bounded registry of the locally bound sockets one endpoint owns.
//!
//! One QUIC endpoint may own several sockets at once: the active one that new connections use,
//! and earlier ones that connections, queued connection attempts or queued stateless responses
//! still depend on after a rebind. Each socket has a stable [`SocketId`] that is never reused,
//! so a stale handle can never select a different socket. Every dependent holds an owned
//! [`Lease`] that is released exactly once, by value; an entry is retired only when no lease and
//! no queued response remains. The number of entries is bounded and a rebind that would exceed
//! the bound is refused without changing anything. Retired sockets are handed back to the caller
//! so their destructors run outside the endpoint lock.
