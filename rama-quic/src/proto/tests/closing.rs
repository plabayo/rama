//! What a connection in the closing state answers, and how often, and what a server may send
//! towards an address it has not validated.
//!
//! RFC 9000 §10.2.1 asks an endpoint in that state to answer received packets progressively less
//! often. These tests drive each side by hand so the peer never learns of the close, and release
//! the peer's packets one at a time, so what earns an answer is exactly what the test says it is.
//! The anti-amplification cases share those hand-driven helpers, which is why they are here.
