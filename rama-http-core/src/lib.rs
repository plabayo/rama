//! Rama http protocol implementation and low level utilities.
//!
//! # Cancel safety
//!
//! Futures returned by this crate's senders are cancel safe: dropping a future before it
//! completes is the supported way to cancel the operation. The protocol in
//! use changes what that cancellation actually does on the wire:
//!
//! - **HTTP/1** has no in-protocol way to abort a single request without
//!   affecting the shared connection, so dropping an in-flight request future
//!   closes the underlying TCP connection. Any subsequent call on the same
//!   `SendRequest` returns a `canceled` error; the connection cannot be
//!   reused.
//! - **HTTP/2** resets the single stream with `RST_STREAM` (`CANCEL` error
//!   code) and notifies the peer immediately rather than continuing to
//!   deliver a response body that would be discarded. The shared connection
//!   stays usable for other in-flight and future requests.
//!
//! See the documentation on individual futures — for example
//! `SendRequest::send_request` in `client::conn::http1` and the equivalent
//! in `client::conn::http2` — for the protocol-specific behavior on
//! cancellation.
