//! HTTP/3 client/server engine and connection-scoped codecs (RFC 9114, RFC 9204).
//!
//! This module holds the stateful pieces that sit above the pure wire vocabulary in
//! [`rama_http_types::proto::h3`]: the bounded incremental frame reader and the stateful QPACK
//! encoder/decoder with their dynamic tables and blocked-section accounting.
//!
//! [`client`] and [`server`] expose Rama requests, responses and the common
//! [`crate::body::Incoming`] body. Run their accompanying [`connection::Driver`]
//! concurrently to drive control and QPACK streams independently of application bodies.
//! The underlying frame and compression codecs also remain usable synchronously.
//!
//! Received field lines retain their order, duplicates, values and sensitivity in
//! the common header map; encoders use its ordered iterator. Names must be lowercase
//! on the H3 wire. The shared [`rama_http_types::proto::h3::PseudoHeaderOrder`] and
//! [`rama_http_types::proto::h3::PseudoHeaderSensitivity`] extensions retain pseudo-field
//! ordering and never-index requirements across forwarding and message edits.
//! Split Cookie lines stay separate in this H3 API, as in H2. Before passing them to
//! a non-H2/H3 context (including a generic server application), coalesce them using
//! `rama_http::layer::remove_header::coalesce_cookie_headers`; the HTTP/1 version
//! adapter does this automatically.
//!
//! This is HTTP message forwarding, not a wire capture/replay API: URI serialization
//! can normalize pseudo-field values, and connection settings, unknown frames, frame
//! boundaries and QPACK representations are not reproduced on another connection.
//!
//! The frame decoder accepts owned [`rama_core::bytes::Bytes`] through
//! [`frame::FrameDecoder::feed_bytes`]. Drain `poll` until it needs more input before feeding the
//! next chunk; rejected input stays with the caller. Contiguous payloads share their input storage,
//! and only fragmented known payloads are coalesced. Input chunk and frame limits are independent.
//!
//! QPACK encoders accept ordinary name/value tuples or [`qpack::EncodeField`] inputs preserving
//! sensitivity. [`qpack::EncodeField::from_header`] carries Rama header sensitivity across the
//! boundary, and decoded [`qpack::FieldPair`] values can be forwarded directly. Optional dynamic
//! compression falls back to literals when reference or encoder-output budgets are exhausted.
//!
//! Drain both QPACK instruction outputs regularly. [`qpack::QpackError::OutputBlocked`] is local
//! backpressure with no wire error code; retry after draining (or split an oversized input batch).
//! Other errors expose their wire code and stream/connection scope. A driver abandoning a field
//! section must also arrange stream cancellation so the remote encoder can release references.
//! Plain decoded literals share section storage. Blocked sections and dynamic-table literals use
//! compact owned storage instead, so small retained slices cannot pin unrelated large buffers.
