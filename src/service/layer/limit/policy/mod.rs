//! Limit policies for [`super::Limit`]
//! define how requests are handled when the limit is reached
//! for a given request.
//!
//! [`Option`] can be used to disable a limit policy for some scenarios
//! while enabling it for others.
//!
//! # Policy Maps
//!
//! A policy which applies a [`Policy`] based on a [`Matcher`].
//! These can be made by using a Vec<([`Matcher`], [`Policy`])>.
//! To avoid cloning you best use an Arc<...> around the most outer vec.
//!
//! The first matching policy is used.
//! If no policy matches, the request is allowed to proceed as well.
//! If you want to enforce a default policy, you can add a policy with a [`Matcher`] that always matches,
//! such as [`matcher::Always`].
//!
//! Note that the [`Matcher`]s will not receive the mutable [`Extensions`],
//! as polices are not intended to keep track of what is matched on.
//!
//! It is this policy that you want to use in case you want to rate limit only
//! external sockets or you want to rate limit specific domains/paths only for http requests.
//! See the [`http_rate_limit.rs`] example for a use case.
//!
//! [`Matcher`]: crate::service::Matcher
//! [`matcher::Always`]: crate::service::matcher::Always
//! [`Extensions`]: crate::service::context::Extensions
