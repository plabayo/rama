//!
//! ü¶ô Rama („É©„Éû) is a modular proxy framework for the ü¶Ä Rust language to move and transform your network packets. You can use it to develop:
//!
//! - üö¶ [Reverse proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/reverse);
//! - üîì [TLS Termination proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/tls);
//! - üåê [HTTP(S) proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/http);
//! - üß¶ [SOCKS5 proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/socks5) (will be implemented in `v0.3`);
//! - üîé [MITM proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/mitm);
//! - üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Distortion proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/distort).
//!
//! Rama is async-first using [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) as its _only_ Async Runtime.
//! Please refer to [the examples found in the `./examples` dir](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples)
//! to get inspired on how you can use it for your purposes.

//!
//! Rama aims to offer a flexible and modular framework that empowers you to
//! effortlessly create your own proxy. Unlike prebuilt tools that can be configured
//! to suit your needs, Rama allows you to build proxies using code.
//! The framework is designed to be both user-friendly and robust,
//! offering a powerful and adaptable solution. Although using code may not be as intuitive
//! as configuring files, it grants you greater freedom and control over the final product.
//! This way, you can create a proxy that precisely fits your requirements and nothing more.
//!
//! Learn more by reading the Rama book at <https://ramaproxy.org/book> or continue to read the framework Rust docs here,
//! to [get started](#getting-started).
//!
//! # High-level features
//!
//! - Rama offers a macro-free API, ensuring a clean and streamlined development experience.
//! - The framework utilizes a tower-like service abstraction, which is poised for
//!   stable Async Rust and future growth.
//! - You can easily compose layers, services, and state from the Transport Layer
//!   to the Application Layer, allowing for a highly customizable solution.
//! - With Rama, you have the freedom to build your own proxy using
//!   the provided building blocks and your own custom logic, resulting in a
//!   tailored and efficient solution.
//!
//! # Edge documentation
//!
//! In case you are using `rama` as a _git_ dependency directly from the `main` branch or
//! a (feature) derivative of you can still consult the rust docs of `rama` online. You can find
//! the "edge" rust docs for the latest `main` _git_ commit of `rama` at:
//!
//! > <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/index.html>
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! rama = "0.2"
//! ```
//!
//! or add it using: `cargo add rama`.
//!
//! See [the examples found in the `./examples` dir](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples)
//! to get inspired on how you can use it for your purposes. Or check the [Rama book](https://ramaproxy.org/book)
//! for more in-depth information.
