🦙 Rama (ラマ) is a modular service framework for the 🦀 Rust language to move and transform your network packets.
The reasons behind the creation of rama can be read in [the "Why Rama" chapter](https://ramaproxy.org/book/why_rama).

## rama-cli

`rama-cli` is the official rama binary, which can be used to proxy requests, make requests and inspect your traffic. It serves mostly as an example to showcase some of what you can do with rama, but of course if you wish you can also use it for your actual production use cases, just know we give no guarantees of any kind.
