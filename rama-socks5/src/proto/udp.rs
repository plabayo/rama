/// Layout for a header sent by a UDP Client (as request) and UDP server (as resonse),
/// for any datagram (to be) relayed by the proxy.
///
/// A UDP-based client MUST send its datagrams to the UDP relay server at
/// the UDP port indicated by BND.PORT in the reply to the UDP ASSOCIATE
/// request.  If the selected authentication method provides
/// encapsulation for the purposes of authenticity, integrity, and/or
/// confidentiality, the datagram MUST be encapsulated using the
/// appropriate encapsulation.  Each UDP datagram carries a UDP request
/// header with it:
///
/// ```plain
/// +----+------+------+----------+----------+----------+
/// |RSV | FRAG | ATYP | DST.ADDR | DST.PORT |   DATA   |
/// +----+------+------+----------+----------+----------+
/// | 2  |  1   |  1   | Variable |    2     | Variable |
/// +----+------+------+----------+----------+----------+
/// ```
///
/// When a UDP relay server decides to relay a UDP datagram, it does so
/// silently, without any notification to the requesting client.
/// Similarly, it will drop datagrams it cannot or will not relay.  When
/// a UDP relay server receives a reply datagram from a remote host, it
/// MUST encapsulate that datagram using the above UDP request header,
/// and any authentication-method-dependent encapsulation.
///
/// The UDP relay server MUST acquire from the SOCKS server the expected
/// IP address of the client that will send datagrams to the BND.PORT
/// given in the reply to UDP ASSOCIATE.  It MUST drop any datagrams
/// arriving from any source IP address other than the one recorded for
/// the particular association.
///
/// The FRAG field indicates whether or not this datagram is one of a
/// number of fragments.  If implemented, the high-order bit indicates
/// end-of-fragment sequence, while a value of X'00' indicates that this
/// datagram is standalone.  Values between 1 and 127 indicate the
/// fragment position within a fragment sequence.  Each receiver will
/// have a REASSEMBLY QUEUE and a REASSEMBLY TIMER associated with these
/// fragments.  The reassembly queue must be reinitialized and the
/// associated fragments abandoned whenever the REASSEMBLY TIMER expires,
/// or a new datagram arrives carrying a FRAG field whose value is less
/// than the highest FRAG value processed for this fragment sequence.
/// The reassembly timer MUST be no less than 5 seconds.  It is
/// recommended that fragmentation be avoided by applications wherever
/// possible.
///
/// Implementation of fragmentation is optional; an implementation that
/// does not support fragmentation MUST drop any datagram whose FRAG
/// field is other than X'00'.
///
/// The programming interface for a SOCKS-aware UDP MUST report an
/// available buffer space for UDP datagrams that is smaller than the
/// actual space provided by the operating system:
///
/// - if ATYP is X'01': 10+method_dependent octets smaller
/// - if ATYP is X'03': 262+method_dependent octets smaller
/// - if ATYP is X'04': 20+method_dependent octets smaller
///
/// # Fragmentation
///
/// Warning. Rama's build in Udp associator / relayer does not
/// support fragmentation and will reject any udp datagram
/// with a header containing a fragment number != 0.
///
/// # Data
///
/// The length of the data is not explicitly defined,
/// nor is the data NULL terminated, instead it is to be assumed
/// that the data (original UDP datagram) is all the bytes received
/// in the datagram containing the header except for the first bytes
/// encoding said header.
