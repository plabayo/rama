/// Home of the transparent-proxy per-flow state machine, the engine
/// handle ownership, and the session / context registration maps.
///
/// `RamaTransparentProxyProvider` is the type the Apple system-extension
/// runtime instantiates and calls into; that subclass requirement is the
/// only reason it exists. The actual logic — receiving an intercepted
/// flow, wiring its read / write pumps to a Rust session, observing
/// `NWConnection` state transitions, cleaning up on terminal events —
/// has no reason to live in a `NETransparentProxyProvider` subclass and
/// historically just did so because it grew there.
///
/// Splitting that logic into this core type lets:
///
/// * unit tests drive the full per-flow lifecycle against a mock flow
///   (`MockTcpFlow` / `MockUdpFlow`) and a mock NWConnection
///   (`MockNwConnection`) without standing up a system extension or
///   real socket;
/// * end-to-end tests exercise the *real* Rust engine with mocked
///   Apple-framework surface, verifying byte flow + cleanup + memory
///   bounds under realistic scheduling;
/// * the provider become a thin adapter that delegates every override
///   to a method on the core, keeping `NETransparentProxyProvider`-
///   subclass-specific concerns (the runtime contract) in one place.
///
/// Frameworks consumed here:
///
/// * `RamaAppleNEFFI` — the Rust engine FFI.
/// * `Network` — for `NWConnection` (egress on TCP flows) and
///   `NWParameters`.
/// * `NetworkExtension` — for `NWHostEndpoint` /
///   `NetworkExtension.NWEndpoint` (kernel-supplied flow endpoints
///   on the UDP read path) and for `NEAppProxyUDPFlow` /
///   `NEAppProxyTCPFlow` typing on the `UdpFlowLike` /
///   `TcpFlowLike` protocols' real-flow implementations. Concrete
///   `NEAppProxyFlow` subclasses and `NEFlowMetaData` extraction
///   live in the provider, not the core; the core never reaches
///   into a real flow's framework innards.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` because mutable state is either confined to
/// `stateQueue` (registration maps, engine handle, flow-count timer)
/// or set once at construction and only mutated via documented
/// single-threaded entry points (`nwConnectionFactory` from tests
/// before any flow handling starts). Swift can't see the runtime
/// invariants; the annotation tells the type system to trust them.
