//! Server-Sent Events (SSE) support
//!
//! ## Server-Sent Events (SSE)
//!
//! Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a simple and efficient mechanism for servers to push real-time updates to
//! clients over HTTP. Unlike WebSockets, which provide full-duplex communication,
//! SSE establishes a one-way channel from server to client using a long-lived HTTP connection.
//!
//! Rama offers support for `SSE` both as a client and a server.
//! As such you could even MITM proxy it.
//!
//! Server `IntoResponse` support is also supported, including with `Keep-Alive` support.
//! See <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/http/service/web/response/struct.Sse.html> for more info.
//!
//! Learn more about SSE at <https://ramaproxy.org/book/sse.html>.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! You can find ready-to-run examples demonstrating how to expose and consume SSE endpoints using Rama:
//!
//! - [`http_sse.rs`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/examples/http_sse.rs)
//!   Simple example showing how to expose an SSE endpoint with string data.
//! - [`http_sse_json.rs`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/examples/http_sse_json.rs)
//!   Same as above, but emits **structured JSON data** using typed Rust structs.
//!
//! These examples make use of Rama's typed header support, such as [`LastEventId`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/rama-http-headers/src/common/last_event_id.rs), which allows easy extraction of reconnect state to resume streams reliably.

//! ## Datastar
//!
//! > Datastar helps you build reactive web applications with the simplicity of server-side rendering and the power of a full-stack SPA framework.
//! >
//! > â€” <https://data-star.dev/>
//!
//! Rama has built-in support for [ðŸš€ data-\*](https://data-star.dev).
//! You can see it in action in [Examples](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples):
//!
//! - [/examples/http_sse_datastar_hello.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples/http_sse_datastar_hello.rs):
//!   SSE Example, showcasing a very simple datastar example,
//!   which is supported by rama both on the client as well as the server side.
//!
//! Rama rust docs:
//!
//! - SSE support: [datastar]
//! - Extractor support (`ReadSignals`): <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/http/service/web/extract/datastar/index.html>
//! - Embedded JS Script: <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/http/service/web/response/struct.DatastarScript.html>
